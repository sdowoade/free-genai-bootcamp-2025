## How to Run

## How to Run
Alternatively, you can run the game using a Python HTTP server. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where your game files are located. You can do this using the `cd` command. For example, if your game files are located in a directory named `Orishas-Quest`, you can navigate to this directory with the following command:

```bash
cd path/to/Orishas-Quest
```

3. Once you're in the correct directory, start the Python HTTP server. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

4. The server will start, and it will tell you the address where you can access your files. By default, this address is `http://localhost:8000`. You can open this address in your web browser to play the game.

Please note that the Python HTTP server serves files from the current directory and its subdirectories. If your game files are located in a different directory, you will need to navigate to that directory before starting the server.
