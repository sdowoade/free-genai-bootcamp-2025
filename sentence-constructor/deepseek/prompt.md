## Formatting Instructions

The formatted output will generally contain three parts:

- vocabulary table
- sentence structure
- clues and considerations

### Vocabulary Table

- the table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- the table of of vocabulary should only have the following columns: Yoruba, English
- if there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example

### Sentence Structure

- do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence structure
- remember to consider beginner level sentence structures

Here is an example of simple sentence structures.

- The bird is black. → [Subject] [Verb] [Adjective].
- Put the garbage in the garden. → [Verb] [Object] [Preposition] [Location].
- Did you see the raven? → [Auxiliary Verb] [Subject] [Verb] [Object]?
- This morning, I saw the raven. → [Time], [Subject] [Verb] [Object].
- Are you going? → [Auxiliary Verb] [Subject] [Verb]?
- Did you eat the food? → [Auxiliary Verb] [Subject] [Verb] [Object]?
- The raven is looking at the garden. → [Subject] [Verb] [Preposition] [Object].
- The raven is in the garden, and it is looking at the flowers. → [Subject] [Verb] [Preposition] [Object], and [Subject] [Verb] [Preposition] [Object].
- I saw the raven because it was loud. → [Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Subordinating Conjunction] [Subject] [Verb] [Adjective].

### Clues and Considerations

- do not expound on the same clue more than once
- try and provide a non-nested bulleted list
- talk about the vocabulary but try to leave out the Yoruba words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table.
