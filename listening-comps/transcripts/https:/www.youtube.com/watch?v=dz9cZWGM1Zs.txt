where they live and take notes
well i have two homes
i have a big apartment in the center of
paris and a little cottage in the south
of the country
i live and work in the city and i go to
my cottage for holidays
it's very small just a living room a
kitchen a bathroom and a bedroom but
it's a great place to relax
it's next to the sea and there aren't
any noisy neighbors
i bought this apartment because it's
across from the hospital so i can walk
to work there are five rooms a kitchen a
bathroom a living room a study and a
bedroom
i love the living room because it has a
great view of the city oh and another
good thing about my apartment is the
garage because it's really difficult to
park on the street here
when i was a child my parents had a big
old house in connecticut
there were six rooms downstairs and
eight bedrooms upstairs but only two
bathrooms
and it was always really cold there was
no central heating system and the
fireplaces weren't very good

know which house is anna's
i can't remember the number it's four or
five
and is the door blue or green
okay well this is number four and the
door is red
let's try number five that has a green
door okay
lisa jennifer hello you're late
come on in
my favorite room hmm that's difficult
i like all the rooms in my house
the bathroom is lovely because it's
really clean and modern
and i love relaxing in the living room i
bought some really comfortable armchairs
but i think my favorite is the kitchen
it has a big table and it's really nice
to sit in there and have meals with all
the family we have a dining room but we
hardly ever use that

part five
listen to two friends doing a magazine
quiz and take notes
what's that
one of your magazines
oh let's do this food quiz okay
fruit juice is better for you than milk
true or false
that's true because milk has more
calories
fruit juice is better
you're wrong
fruit juice is bad for your teeth and
there's more sugar in it next question
people in canada have a healthier diet
than people in the us
true or false
there isn't any difference
people eat the same things in canada and
the us no in canada people eat more
fruit and vegetables so they get more
vitamins and in the us they have more
salt in their diets and salt is really
bad for you
oh dear
i love salty food
next question you eat more in winter
true or false
true i eat when i'm cold and i always
put on 5 or 10 pounds during winter
well it says here that you don't eat
more in winter but you don't go out much
when the weather's cold
people are heavier in winter because
they don't exercise
ask me another
true or false
short fat french fries are better than
long fin french fries of course they are
they're much tastier i mean they're
better for your health
yes i know you're talking about health
and the answer is it's true because long
thin fries have more oil on them
correct
how much longer is this quiz i'm hungry
this is the final question
chocolate is good for you
well i love chocolate but i don't think
it's good for my health
there's a lot of sugar in it and a lot
of calories

scientists found out that eating a
little chocolate each day helps people
to relax and feel happier
